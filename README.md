### Motivation
Ubuntu Walker is a program that takes the Linux operating system source code as an input parameter. The Ubuntu archives are then mined and the source code files are extracted. This script was used to generate the LSC (Linux-Source-Code) Machine Learning Dataset.  The main reason for building this program was was ability to quickly generate a dataset for source-code classifiers. 

ðŸš§ Warning This code was an experiment for the Spring of 2018, and is not for production use. However, the dataset is completely safe to use. 

### Don't want to run our script, and just want the dataset? 
The full dataset, is available from (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YGA1EytPcmc84yfYABdInMXsLBoz82M4).

### What does it do
* Extracts source code files from .tar archive files in the Linux operating system. tar archives supported are .bz2, .xz, .gz
* Classifies the extracted files depending on file extension and stores them in corresponding folder.
* Currently classified file types supported are: Java, C, C++, Ruby, Python, JavaScript.

### Dataset Summary 
There are six different source code folders generated from this script, A short summary of the dataset is provided below:
* Java Source Code folder - contains 1 source code files.   
* C Source Code folder - contains 1 source code files. 
* C++ Source Code folder - contains 1 source code files. 
* Ruby Source Code folder - contains 1 source code files. 
* Python Source Code folder - contains 1 source code files. 
* JavaScript  Source Code folder - contains 1 source code files. 

Please refer to the dataset (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YGA1EytPcmc84yfYABdInMXsLBoz82M4) for more details.
